Building the project
====================
This project, like all our projects uses phing to setup the config and make it ready 
to deliver pages. The build script in this project is a cut down version of our 
production scripts.

Start by listing the actions available to you:

  phing -l

To build the project, run:

  phing

which is an alias of "phing build:build". This will build the project which by default 
does very little. What it does do is setup the Apache config in:

  config/httpd.include

This is generated by scanning config/httpd.include.skel and replacing the variables like
"${build.url}". 

Once httpd.include is generated, you should symlink this into the Apache include directory
(which is typically /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/) and restart Apache.
